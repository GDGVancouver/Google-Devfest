    <p>
      We would like to take this opportunity to thank our amazing team here at{" "}
      {process.env.REACT_APP_CHAPTER_NAME}. Without a dedicated and highly
      motivated team to manage the event, find sponsorships, develop the
      website, take the initiatives, and coordinate the procurement of speakers,
      food and the community, DevFest 2022 would not have been possible. So
      please give them a huge round of applause and remember to consider them
      for your future tech projects!
    </p>
